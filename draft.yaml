# supplier provides at 4.6% so 1000 - 46 also converted in to usd 954 * 1.27 = 1211.58
# also depends on the rate the collector set if usd gone up it will be in profit
# else will be in loss i.e 1 = 1.265 then 1211.58/1.265 = 957.8 which means a loss 
# of 3.8 means percentage profit reduction of 0.38% so 4.6 - 0.38 = 4.22
